[DESCRIPTION]
Read XML or binary SII information from the input file and generates a binary
EEPROM file.  If no input file is provided the program reads from stdin. With
-p option the content of the ESI or SII is printed in human readable format. No
further output is generated.

Writing of the Rx- and TxPDO into the SII file is optional.

The siitool supports ESI fiels with multiple devices described. If no device is
selected the first device is used.
